Illusion is a Smart Mirror that will display information that the user wishes to see.
This includes the time, date, weather, news, and much more while functioning
as a mirror. Illusion will also use voice commands to fetch and display different internet searches
using Amazon Alexa's API.

Illusion may not have been possible without the helpful software of Magic Mirror 2.
